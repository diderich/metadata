# Name
Metadata: A PHP classes for reading and writing metadata from JPG files in a transparent way


# Version
See `CHANGELOG.md` and php constant `\Holiday\Metadata::VERSION` for the latest version number.


# Description
The **Metadata** class and its sub-classes implement read and write access to IPTC data and read access to EXIF data
from JPG files, focusing on those metadata elements that are relevant for searching and managing photos within a photo
database or similar application.

There exist many implementations for reading and/or writing metadata from photos of various formats. Typically, these
packages and programs (exiftool being the most prominent one) focus on decoding raw data in the context of its origin,
e.g., decoding EXIF data or decoding IPTC/APP13 data. This project takes a different approach! It takes a user-centric
approach and exposes IPTC and EXIF data in a transparent way to the user, i.e, the user does not have to worry where the
data is coming from and/or how it is encoded.

The package has been developed in the context of developing the proprietary HOLIDAY photo database software (see
https://www.cdsp.photo/technology/holiday-database/), the end-user. As such it may lack functionality relevant for
different uses. This explains the use of the top-level namespace prefix `\Holiday`.

The decoding and encoding of the JPG image file into different header segments as well as the decoding and encoding of
the IPTC data is inspired in part by **The PHP JPEG Metadata Toolkit** (https://www.ozhiker.com/electronics/pjmt/),
which is hereby duly acknowledged.


## Transparent access to JPG image metadata
The class `\Holiday\Metadata` allows reading and writing the most relevant (from the author's perspective) data in JPEG
files and access them in a transparent way, independent of how they are stored. Data for a field FIELD_ID can be read
from file FILENAME using the following code. If no data is found `$data` will be equal to `false`, otherwise contain the
read data, which may be a string, an integer, or an array:

```php
$metadata = new \Holiday\Metadata();

$metadata->read(FILENAME);
$data = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::FIELD_ID);
```

Data in field FIELD_ID can be updated to NEW_DATA and written back to the same file or a new different file NEW_FILENAME
using the code:

```php 
$metadata->set(\Holiday\Metadata::FIELD_ID, NEW_DATA); 
$metadata->write(NEW_FILENAME);
``` 

The file NEW_FILENAME is automatically overwritten.

If you want to past the editable part of the metadata from one file FILENAME to another one named PASTE_FILENAME (which
must exist), you can do so use the following code:

```php
$metadata = new \Holiday\Metadata();

$metadata->read(FILENAME);
$metadata->paste(PASTE_FILENAME);
```

The metadata is read in the following order, the first data read taking priority, i.e, if the CAPTION data is stored in
the IPTC/APP13 segment as well as in the XMP/APP1 and EXIF/APP1 segment, the data from the IPTC/APP13 will prevail.

1. Data found in the IPTC/APP13 segment
2. Data found the XMP/APP1 segment
3. Data found in the EXIF/APP1 segment

When writing the metadata back, both IPTC/APP13 and XMP/APP1 fields will be updated to ensure consistency of the
data. In the current implementation, user modifiable data stored in the EXIF/APP1 segment is cleared, i.e., replaced by
0x00, rather than updated to the actual value. This choice is due to a) the opinion that EXIF/APP1 should not contain
user-editable data and b) the complexity of the EXIF/APP1 data format.

## Exception handling
All functions return `false`in case of non-fatal errors. Fatal errors trigger the exception
`\Holiday\Metadata\Exception` to be thrown (which extends the generic `Exception` class). The numerical code associated
with an error (`$exception->getCode()`) allows identifying the type of the error. Constants are defined in the exception
class `\Holiday\Metadata\Exception`.

The function `\Holiday\Metadata\Exception::getData()`returns additional data relevant to the thrown exception in human
readable form.

All exception messages are translatable using the `gettext` library. A translation template is provided in the `locale`
directory.

# Example
The following example shows how to read, modify, and write metadata from JPG files in a transparent way (see also
`test/example.php`). Is requires/assumes a PSR-4 compliant mechanism for loading the class files.

```php
// Create an instance of the Metadata class
$metadata = new \Holiday\Metadata();

try {
  // Read metadata from the image file FILENAME
  $metadata->read(FILENAME);

  // Read some of the metadata (assuming metadata is available)
  $caption = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::CAPTION);
  $date_created = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::CREATED_DATETIME);
  $credit = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::CREDIT);
  $city = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::CITY);
  $country = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::COUNTRY);
  $people = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::PEOPLE);
  $keywords = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::KEYWORDS);
  $event = $metadata->get(\Holiday\Metadata::EVENT);
  if($caption !== false) echo "CAPTION:  $caption".PHP_EOL;
  if($credit !== false) echo "CREDIT:   $credit".PHP_EOL;
  if($city !== false && $country !== false) echo "PLACE:    $city, $country".PHP_EOL;
  if($date_created !== false) echo "CREATED:  ".date('d.m.Y', $date_created).PHP_EOL;
  if($event !== false) echo "EVENT:    $event".PHP_EOL;
  if($keywords !== false) echo "KEYWORDS: ".implode(', ', $keywords).PHP_EOL;
  if($people !== false) echo "PEOPLE:   ".implode(', ', $people).PHP_EOL;

  // Update some data
  if($caption !== false && $date_created !== false && $city !== false && $country !== false && $credit !== false) {
    $caption = strtoupper($city).', '.strtoupper($country).' - '.strtoupper(date('F d', $date_created)).': '.
      $caption.' (Photo by '.$credit.')';
    $metadata->set(\Holiday\Metadata::CAPTION, $caption);
  }
  if($event !== false) $metadata->set(\Holiday\Metadata::EVENT, strtoupper($event));


  // Write metadata back to the image file
  $metadata->write(FILENAME);

  // Paste user modifiable metadata do a different file
  $metadata->paste(ALTERNATE_FILE);
```

# File and directory structure
The directory structure shown describes the most relevant directories and files of the library.

All class files are commended in a phpDocumenter (https://www.phpdoc.org/) compliant way.

# Installation
The metadata class can be installed using composer

```shell
composer require diderich/meta
```

# Testing
The classes have been successfully tested on a number of JPG images written by a non-exhaustive list of different camera
models. As decoding data is highly dependent on the choices made when encoding the data, the class may be unable to
decode some less common JPG file encodings. This is especially the case for data stored (in a less compliant way) using
th XMP format.

No exhaustive test concept for the classes exists and/or is planned.

If you find a JPG file that is not correctly decoded, please raise an issue in the `Issue` section AND include a copy of
the JPG file. Issus without accompanying JPG data will be closed by the author without consideration.


# Open issues
The following limitations currently exist and are acknowledged as such:
* IPTC/APP13: Only Latin 1 and UTF-8 encoded data can be read. Other data formats will throw an exception.
* XMP/APP1: The classes Xmp and/or XmpDocument may nor recognize all poorly/incorrectly formatted XMP/APP1 data.
* XMP/APP1: If an data element TAG is updated in the namespace NS, then it will also be updated in the namespaces
  Iptc4xmpCore, dc, aux, xmp, photoshop, and photomechanic, if a data entry exists in those name spaces. Other name
  spaces, for example, used by other applications, are not updated. This may result in inconsistent data.
* EXIF/APP1: Although all data read is returned, only the data considered relevant is decoded. For example, thumbnails
  or markernotes are not decoded. Data not decoded is return as a human readable hexadecimal string.
* EXIF/APP1: Due to the complexity of writing EXIF/APP1 data, the IPTC/NAA records in the EXIF IFD are not updated. They
  are overwritten with \x00.
The author is not aiming a removing these limitations in the future.


# Idea for future development
Although not currently planned, The would love to see the class implement multi-lingual metadata, allowing reading and
writing of the same data fields in different languages. For example, caption information could be stored in English,
French, and German in/with the same image. The multi-lingual framework exists in the XMP specification (attribute
`xml:lang="x-default"` in text, rdf:Alt, and rdf:Bag elements), but I am currently not aware of any photo handling
software that exploits this possibility.
